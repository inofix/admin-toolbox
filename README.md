# admin-toolbox
Simple scripts collection to ease an admins life.

You might want to start looking at 'makebashscript.sh' as
most of the (little more complex) bash scripts here will
initially be generated by this script. Simpler scripts should
be written sh-compatible and might be too simple to get in
here..
