# backupninja plugins

This is a collection of custom backupninja plugins.

On debian-based distros the package is called 'backupninja'.
The scripts go to /usr/share/backupninja/ while the config
examples are meant to be here /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/.
The example might then be copied to /etc/backup.d/ to enable
the plugin..
